      "      LLM Powered Autonomous Agents\n",

      "Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\n",
      "Agent System Overview#\n",
      "In a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\n",
      "\n",
      "Planning\n",
      "\n",
      "Subgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\n",
      "Reflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Memory\n",
      "\n",
      "Short-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\n",
      "Long-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Tool use\n",
      "\n",
      "The agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Component One: Planning#\n",
      "A complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\n",
      "Task Decomposition#\n",
      "Chain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\n",
      "Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\n",
      "Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\n",
      "Another quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\n",
      "Self-Reflection#\n",
      "Self-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\n",
      "ReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\n",
      "The ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\n",
      "Thought: ...\n",
      "Action: ...\n",
      "Observation: ...\n",
      "... (Repeated many times)\n",
      "copy\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "In both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\n",
      "Reflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action at, the agent computes a heuristic ht and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\n",

      "\n",
      "Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\n",
      "\n",
      "The heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\n",
      "Self-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\n",
      "\n",
      "Chain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of Dh={(x,yi,ri,zi)}i=1n, where x is the prompt, each yi is a model completion, ri is the human rating of yi, and zi is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, rn≥rn−1≥⋯≥r1 The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of τh=(x,zi,yi,zj,yj,…,zn,yn), where ≤i≤j≤n. The model is finetuned to only predict yn where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\n",
      "To avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\n",
      "The training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\n",
      "In reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\n",
      "In comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\n",

      "Component Two: Memory#\n",
      "(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\n",
      "Types of Memory#\n",
      "Memory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Short-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Long-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\n",
      "\n",
      "Explicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\n",
      "Implicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Categorization of human memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can roughly consider the following mappings:\n",
      "\n",
      "Sensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\n",
      "Short-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\n",
      "Long-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\n",
      "The external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)​ algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\n",
      "A couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\n",
      "\n",
      "LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\n",
      "ANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\n",
      "HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\n",
      "FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\n",
      "ScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point xi to x~i such that the inner product ⟨q,xi⟩ is as similar to the original distance of ∠q,x~i as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\n",

      "Component Three: Tool Use#\n",
      "Tool use is a remarkable and distinguishing characteristic of human beings. We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\n",

      "MRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\n",
      "They did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\n",
      "Both TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\n",

      "The system comprises of 4 stages:\n",
      "(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\n",
      "Instruction:\n",
      "\n",
      "The AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can't be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\n",
      "Instruction:\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request.

We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\n",
      "Instruction:\n",
      "\n",
      "With the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user's request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\n",
      "To put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\n",
      "API-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\n",

      "\n",
      "Whether an API call is needed.\n",
      "Identify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\n",
      "Response based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "This benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\n",
      "\n",
      "Level-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\n",
      "Level-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\n",
      "Level-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\n",

      "One interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\n",

       "'\\n---\\nQuestion: 1. What are the key architectural components of an LLM-powered autonomous agent system?\\nAnswer: The key architectural components of an LLM-powered autonomous agent system are:\\n\\n1.  **Large Language Model (LLM):** This is the core of the system, acting as the agent’s “brain.” It’s responsible for understanding instructions, generating plans, reasoning, and producing actions.\\n\\n2.  **Memory:** Agents need to remember past experiences and information to make informed decisions. There are several types of memory:\\n    *   **Short-Term Memory (STM):**  Used for immediate context, like the current conversation or the most recent actions.\\n    *   **Long-Term Memory (LTM):** Stores persistent knowledge, facts, and learned skills. This can be implemented using various techniques like vector databases, knowledge graphs, or even simple text files.\\n\\n3.  **Planner:** This component takes the LLM’s output (a plan) and breaks it down into a sequence of concrete actions. It translates high-level goals into executable steps.\\n\\n4.  **Action Executor:** This component executes the actions generated by the planner. It interacts with the environment, using tools and APIs to achieve the desired outcome.\\n\\n5.  **Tool Use:** Agents often need to leverage external tools to accomplish tasks. These tools can range from simple APIs (e.g., searching the web, sending emails) to more complex systems (e.g., controlling robots, managing databases).\\n\\n6.  **Observation:** The agent observes the environment after taking an action. This observation provides feedback on the outcome of the action and is used to inform future planning and decision-making.\\n\\n7.  **Feedback Loop:** This is a crucial component that connects all the other components. The agent observes the environment, receives feedback, and uses this information to refine its plans and actions. This iterative process allows the agent to learn and improve over time.\\n\\n8. **Prompt Engineering:** This is the process of crafting effective prompts for the LLM to elicit the desired behavior. It\\'s a critical skill for building effective autonomous agents.\\n\\n---\\nCan you provide a more detailed explanation of the memory components, specifically focusing on vector databases and knowledge graphs?</h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1></h1>\\n---\\nQuestion: 2. How do LLMs interact with other components in an autonomous agent system?\\nAnswer: Okay, let\\'s delve deeper into how Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with the other components of an autonomous agent system, with a particular focus on memory components like vector databases and knowledge graphs.\\n\\nThe interaction isn\\'t a simple, linear process; it’s a dynamic, iterative loop. Here’s a breakdown:\\n\\n**1. The LLM as Orchestrator:** The LLM isn’t just *used* by the other components; it *orchestrates* their interactions. It receives information from memory, plans actions based on that information, and then instructs the Action Executor to carry out those actions.  It’s constantly monitoring the environment through Observation and using that feedback to refine its understanding and future plans.\\n\\n**2. Memory Components – The Agent’s Long-Term and Short-Term Recall:**\\n\\n*   **Short-Term Memory (STM) – The Immediate Context:** This is typically handled directly by the LLM’s context window.  It’s the most immediate information – the current conversation, the last few actions taken, and any relevant details from the current observation.  The LLM directly uses this to inform its next prompt.  However, context windows are limited, so STM alone isn’t sufficient for complex tasks.\\n\\n*   **Long-Term Memory (LTM) – Persistent Knowledge and Experience:** This is where vector databases and knowledge graphs come in.  They provide a way to store and retrieve information *outside* the LLM’s context window.\\n\\n    *   **Vector Databases:** These are crucial for storing *embeddings* – numerical representations of text, images, or other data.  Here’s how they work in an agent system:\\n        *   **Encoding:** When the agent encounters new information (e.g., reading a webpage, receiving a user instruction), it’s encoded into an embedding using a model like OpenAI’s embeddings API or a locally hosted model.\\n        *   **Storage:** These embeddings are stored in the vector database.\\n        *   **Retrieval:** When the LLM needs information, it generates a query embedding. The vector database then finds the embeddings most similar to the query embedding – effectively retrieving relevant pieces of information.\\n        *   **Injection:** The retrieved information (the original text or data associated with the similar embedding) is then injected into the LLM’s prompt, providing it with the context it needs.\\n        *   **Example:** Imagine the agent needs to write an email about a specific product. It might retrieve relevant product descriptions, customer reviews, and competitor information from the vector database and include that in its prompt to the LLM.\\n\\n    *   **Knowledge Graphs:** These are structured representations of knowledge, consisting of nodes (entities) and edges (relationships between entities).\\n        *   **Construction:** Knowledge graphs are built from various sources – text, databases, APIs.  The LLM can be used to extract entities and relationships from text and populate the graph.\\n        *   **Querying:** The LLM can query the knowledge graph to retrieve specific facts or relationships.  For example, it could ask, \"What are the key features of product X?\" and the knowledge graph would provide the relevant information.\\n        *   **Integration:** The LLM can then use this information to inform its planning and action execution.\\n        *   **Example:**  An agent managing a supply chain could use a knowledge graph to understand the relationships between suppliers, factories, warehouses, and customers.\\n\\n**3. The Interaction Loop – A Cycle of Information:**\\n\\n1.  **Observation:** The agent observes the environment and receives feedback.\\n2.  **LLM Prompting:** The LLM receives the observation and relevant information from memory (vector database and/or knowledge graph). It formulates a prompt based on this information.\\n3.  **Planning:** The LLM generates a plan of action.\\n4.  **Action Execution:** The Planner breaks down the plan into concrete actions, which are then executed by the Action Executor.\\n5.  **Feedback & Memory Update:** The Action Executor’s results are observed, and the agent updates its memory (adding new embeddings to the vector database, updating the knowledge graph, or refining its STM).\\n6.  **Repeat:** The cycle repeats, with the LLM using the updated memory to inform its next prompt and plan.\\n\\n**4. Prompt Engineering’s Role:**  Effective prompt engineering is *essential* for this interaction to work well.  The prompts need to be carefully crafted to guide the LLM to retrieve the correct information from memory and to generate appropriate actions.  Techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are specifically designed to leverage vector databases and improve LLM performance.\\n\\n**In summary:** LLMs don\\'t operate in isolation. They are the central coordinator, relying heavily on external memory components – vector databases and knowledge graphs – to provide the context and knowledge needed to make informed'"
